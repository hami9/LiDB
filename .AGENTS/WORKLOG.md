# Agent worklog

**Append-only factual record.** Do not write fictional completions. Record UTC timestamps, branch/commit, task ID, changed paths, commands run, outcomes, simulated vs real environment and next action.

## 2026-10-08 — Documentation and agent-workspace bootstrap

- Actor: ChatGPT (repository documentation bootstrap).
- Phase: P0 preparation; **no phase implementation completed**.
- Scope: architecture reference, product and security specifications, open-source project setup, agent guidance, delivery gates and templates.
- Environment: GitHub repository operations; no host compilation, GPU benchmark, network diagnostics or eBPF execution.
- Verification: document links and repository tree review planned at handoff; **runtime/unit/hardware tests NOT RUN** because no application implementation exists.
- Risks/open decisions: minimum kernel/toolchain, IPC format, exact telemetry schema and hardware validation matrix.
- Next action: maintainer selects P0 first vertical slice, then an agent creates tested Rust workspace scaffolding.
